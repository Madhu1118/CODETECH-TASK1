Overview of the project.

This project is a simple yet functional calculator program written in Python. It is designed to provide users with a quick and efficient way to perform basic arithmetic operations through a command-line interface. The calculator supports four fundamental operations:

Addition – Summing two numbers.

Subtraction – Calculating the difference between two numbers.

Multiplication – Finding the product of two numbers.

Division – Dividing one number by another (with error handling for division by zero).


The program follows a user-friendly and interactive approach, allowing users to input two numbers and choose the desired operation from a menu. After performing the calculation, the result is displayed, and the user is given the option to continue performing more calculations or exit the program.

The calculator is built with simplicity in mind, making it suitable for beginners who are learning Python or basic programming concepts. The code is modular, with separate functions for each operation, ensuring readability and maintainability.

Additionally, the program includes basic error handling to manage invalid inputs, such as entering non-numeric values or attempting to divide by zero. This enhances the user experience by preventing crashes and providing informative error messages.

This project can serve as a foundational exercise for learning Python, practicing control flow, and understanding user input handling. It can also be expanded to include more advanced mathematical functions, such as exponentiation, square roots, or trigonometric operations, providing a path for further development.

The simple calculator is a great starting point for anyone interested in creating practical Python applications and can easily be integrated into larger projects or serve as a utility for quick calculations.
